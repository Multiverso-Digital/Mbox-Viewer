# Mbox-Viewer
This program reads files with the .MBOX extension generated by Gmail backup.

You need to have Acrobat Reader installed on your computer to read .PDF attachments.

Attachments will be extracted to the "Attachments" folder and messages to the "Messages" 
folder in the EmailBox2.0 program folder.


You must have Microsoft Edge and Acrobat Reader installed on your computer.


Without them you will not be able to see the attachments. However, the attachments will be


saved in the Attachments folder.

If the MBOX file is too big, the process can take hours to get the messages and attachments.

The program is Freeware. It opens .mbox files, extracts messages and attachments and saves 
them in two folders. The one for attachments and the one for messages. It shows on the main 
screen the list of extracted messages containing the FROM, Subject, TO, Date, Size and if it has 
an attachment. Just double click on the selected line and the program will show the complete
message, all attachments and the message header.
